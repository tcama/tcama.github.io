# Lipid Nanotechnologies

Lipid-Nanotechnologies employed nanointaglio technology to miniaturize the pharmaceutical screening process, allowing for reduced materials costs and increased throughput. I was one of four cofounders and served as Chief Data Officer. We incorporated in 2012 after winning the Innolevation competition, which was sponsored by the Jim Moran Institute for Global Entrepreneurship and Florida State University College of Business. We developed a promotional video explaining the technology, created a comprehensive business plan for commercialization, and pitched our idea to investors. After three rounds, we emerged from the 78 competitors victorious, receiving $150,000 in funding and services. As Lipid-Nanotech, we entered into an option agreement to license nanointaglio patents from the University, submitted an SBIR application to the NIH, and pitched our innovation to follow-on investors. The companyâ€™s progress stalled during license negotiations with the University, but I learned an immense amount from the experience, and it ignited my passion for translational research.
