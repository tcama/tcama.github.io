# Radio Wyrd

Radio Wyrd is an internet radio variety show that centers on music and interesting conversations. The show is hosted and produced by my good friend Sawyer Vanderwerff. It has a distinctive visual style, not entirely unlike watching a VHS tape that has been repeated smashed with a baseball bat. I make guest appearances on a segment of the show called "Delta Waves" which pairs light science with irreverent conversation.
