# RadioWyrd

RadioWyrd is an internet variety show that centers on music and interesting conversations. It has a distinctive visual style, not entirely unlike watching a VHS tape that has been repeated smashed with a baseball bat. I make guest appearances on a segment of the show called "Delta Waves" which pairs light science with irreverent.
