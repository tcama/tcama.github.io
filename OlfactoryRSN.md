# Olfactory Brain Network

My first research paper is currently available on BioRxiv, soon to be published in eNeuro! In the paper my collaborators and I describe the network of brain regions that enable odor processing. We also demonstrate that individual differences in network connectivity underlie differences odor sensitivity.
