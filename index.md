# About Me

As a kid, I always wanted to be a scientist, but I didn’t really understand what scientist do. Now I know I’ve become a scientist, because I have no clue what I do anymore. 

Every time someone asks me about my work, I give a different answer. Over years I’ve started a nanotechnology company, collected tree frogs, designed helmets, examined how our brains process smells, gone to medical school, and developed a brain-computer interface. Currently, I study neuroimaging in epilepsy patients and clinical applications for low-field MRI. 

What I’ve learned is that if it smells like science, I’ll give it a try. I have a sensation seeking personality and love new experiences, new data, new challenges. For me, science present the opportunity for growth and it is the perfect profession for the eternal optimist.
